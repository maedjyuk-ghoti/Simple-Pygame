Notes:
* The only infinite loop in the entire program is in the Manager class.
   It uses a dictionary to control what is shown on screen (which menu or the game)
   Because of this, the only call in the infinite loop is:
---- self.views[self.curr_view].display()
   Therefore, any class that is called directly from the Manager class must have a:
---- def display(self):
   function
